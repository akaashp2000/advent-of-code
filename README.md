## Instructions

1. Clone this repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/akaashp2000/advent-of-code
```
2. Install the requirements (in a virtual environment if you wish)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Add a `.env` file in the main directory with 

`AOC_SESSION=...`

as detailed [here](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-wim/issues/1), including your session cookie in quotation marks.
This is to allow you to:
* use the `aocd` package to get required data and examples for the challenges
* submit solutions via `aocd` from Python

4. All the notebooks should be runnable now.
